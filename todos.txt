Optimization Targets:
1) Priority
2) Weighted
3) 

separate collection?

---

Decision Alternatives:

needed or implied based on computation method?


---

OptimizationTarget:
- Attribute 
- Goal: Min/Max 

Constraint?

Approach
    (e.g.: AssetReplacement)
    => Comp. Method!!


---

@Attribute: Goals
@Service: Attribute + Actual Goal
@Requirement: Attribute + Actual Goal

@Target: Attribute + Goal
@Service: Target
@Requirement: Target

TODO constraints? -> analogously
